# The following Python file is for the shell commands.
# The result of this is to create a shell similar to terminal. The bash commands shall include:
#       $ - To print string
#       $ ls | sort -r) - For piping and sorting result
#       $ $ find/etc -print & - For running background task(Having a task run on the background
#       $ ls > /tmp/files.txt) - redirection of input and output
#       $PATH - Finding the directory, folder or file path
#       cd - change directory
#       exit - end bash shell

# The following program was taken from last semester (Spring 2020) when I attempted to take
# Theory of OperatingSystems with Dr. Roach. I have for the most part converted my code from
# C to python, however I've run into an issue with piping.
